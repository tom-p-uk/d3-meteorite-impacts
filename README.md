# D3 Meteorite Strikes

A D3 v4 map of the Earth that visualises the location and relative mass of global meteorite impacts.

### User Stories:

1. I can see where all Meteorites landed on a world map.
2. I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it's represented on the map.
3. I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.
